Notes | controller mapping is pretty weird (e.g. B to accept and A to cancel) and cannot be edited; navigating the menu is hard and quitting doesn't work (fortunately the game is saved at checkpoints) | keyboard/mouse controls can be edited in the meny but some of the functions overlap (e.g. select / go to) so in general controls are rather bad |
